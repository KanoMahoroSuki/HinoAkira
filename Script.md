# The Script of Tina Rex's Wonderlands

T. rex: I am Tina Rex, the Queen of the kingdom of dinosaurs, Mondstadt. My kingdom was destroyed in a battle with Godzilla 66 million years, and I lost my father Tim Rex. My cousins went extinct, but I survived until today. Brave traveller, I need your help to defeat Godzilla and bring glory to Mondstadt!

Tina Rex: Are you willing to help me?

Traveller: Yes. (Choose options on the phone.)

Tina Rex: Thank you, Traveller! What is your name?

Traveller: XXX

Tina Rex: … Doesn’t sound like a local name to me. Anyway, you are now the honorary knight of Mondstadt.

Tina Rex: It’s time to face the Godzilla, but not in this outfit. I have prepared the amour for you.

Traveller: Get dressed.

Tina Rex: Wow! It’s perfect for you. Now you need a powerful weapon! I left a sword at uncle penguin’s place. Go to the bird gallery and talk to him! If you find him, just scan the QR code near him.

Traveller: Scan.

Penguin: Hello, Traveller! I have heard of you! Please bring the best sword! Take care of yourself.

Tina Rex: Great! Godzilla has some soldiers working for him. Let’s defeat them together. There is an Indian Lion nearby. When you find him, scan the QR code to fight.

Traveller: Scan.

Indian Lion: Interesting! You want to challenge Godzilla? It’s impossible.

Traveller: Choose the attacking way (1. Attack by Sword 2. Punch)

(You defeated Indian Lion!)

Indian Lion: Ah, I didn’t expect that, but you will never win Godzilla! (Obtain Key “T”)

Tina Rex: Hooray! We win! Seems that you are ready to fight Godzilla. Let’s head to the 1st floor of the museum!

Tina Rex: Look, Godzilla is in the Extinct and Endangered Species Area! Get ready to fight! As always, scan the QR code when you find him.

Traveller: Scan.

Godzilla: Hm, I didn’t think you’d be here, but I won’t let you get out alive!

Traveller: Choose the attacking way (1. Attack by Sword 2. Punch)

(You were defeated by Godzilla!)

Tina Rex: That was close, but I’m glad that we escaped. Godzilla has been much stronger for his daily workouts. We need more powerful weapons. Let’s go to the Mineral Gallery! We may find something useful there.

Tina Rex: Look at the meteorite! Actually, my ancestors went extinct because of an impact of an asteroid. Scan the QR code, and take the meteorite with you, it will bring you power. I will see you in the next room.

Traveller: Scan. (Obtain key “R”)

Tina Rex: Now you see the real me. Here is another Key for you, and don’t forget to take selfies with me. (Obtain key “E”)

Tina Rex: There is a kangaroo nearby, she also works for Godzilla. When you see her, scan the QR code and try to get some information from her.

Traveller: Scan.

Kangaroo: Hmm, another one to challenge Godzilla? You look more powerful than those previous challengers. I have heard that you defeated Indian Lion, but you will never beat me!

Traveller: Choose the attacking way (1. Attack by Sword 2. Punch)

(You defeated the Kangaroo!)

Kangaroo: You win! I am convinced by your power! (Obtain Key “X”)

Tina Rex: Bravo! You have now collected four keys, there must be a treasure nearby. Let’s go to the T. rex skeleton hall! We may find the treasure there.

Tina Rex: Seems that the introductions on the wall are important. Maybe you should pay attention to the information.

Tina Rex: There is a dig site in that room, the treasure must be hidden there!
Tina Rex: If you find the Dig Site, scan the QR code nearby!

Traveller: Scan.

Tina Rex: Oh, there is a question for you! Am I a predator or scavenger?

Traveller: 1. Predator, 2. Scavenger, 3. Both. (If the answer is not correct, the Tina Rex will ask players to go back to the skeleton hall and look for the answers)

Tina Rex: That’s right! And you got the treasure chest! Use the keys you collected to open it!

Traveller: TREX

Tina Rex: It opened! Congratulations! You got an Amos’ Bow! Now you got the power to fight Godzilla again! Go back to the Extinct and Endangered Species Area when you are ready.

Traveller: Scan

Godzilla: Traveller, nice to see you again! But I won’t let you sneak this time!

Traveller: I challenge you…

Traveller: … To a duel before the throne!

Tina Rex: Proceed.

Godzilla: You are aware… that the loser must die? Are you sure this is what you want?

Traveller: Choose the attacking way (1. Attack by Sword 2. Attack by Amos’ Bow, 3. Punch)

(You defeated Godzilla!)

Godzilla: It’s impossible! Ah, how could I?!

Tina Rex: Thank you, Traveller! You have defeated Godzilla and saved my kingdom! I am willing to let my daughter, Astrologist Mona Megistus, marry you!

Traveller: Thank you, Tina Rex!

The Traveller and the princess lived happily ever after.

The End.
